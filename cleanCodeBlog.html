    <p>Let’s say you believe that messy code is a significant impediment. Let’s say that you accept
        that the only way to go fast is to keep your code clean. Then you must ask yourself: “How
        do I write clean code?” It’s no good trying to write clean code if you don’t know what it
        means for code to be clean!
        The bad news is that writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Most of us
        know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to recognize good art from
        bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So too being able to recognize clean code
        from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!</p>

    <h3>What Is Clean Code?</h3>
    <p>There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers. So I asked some very
        well-known and deeply experienced programmers what they thought. <br>
        <b>Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++
            and author of The C++ Programming
            Language said</b> <br>
            <i style="opacity: 0.5">"I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The
                logic should be straightforward to make it hard
                for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to
                ease maintenance, error handling complete
                according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt
                people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing
                well"</i>
            <br> <br>
        Bjarne uses the word “elegant.” That’s quite a word! The dictionary in my MacBook®
        provides the following definitions: pleasingly graceful and stylish in appearance or manner; pleasingly ingenious and simple. Notice the
        emphasis on the word “pleasing.” Apparently Bjarne thinks that clean code is pleasing to
        read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed
        car would.
    </p>

    <p>Bjarne also mentions efficiency—twice. Perhaps this should not surprise us coming
        from the inventor of C++; but I think there’s more to it than the sheer desire for speed.
        Wasted cycles are inelegant, they are not pleasing. And now note the word that Bjarne uses
        8 Chapter 1: Clean Code
        to describe the consequence of that inelegance. He uses the word “tempt.” There is a deep
        truth here. Bad code tempts the mess to grow! When others change bad code, they tend to
        make it worse. </p>

    <p>Pragmatic Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt said this a different way. They used the metaphor of broken windows.3 A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about
        it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually
        they actively break them. They despoil the facade with graffiti and allow garbage to collect. One broken window starts the process toward decay.</p>
    
    <p>Bjarne also mentions that error handing should be complete. This goes to the discipline of paying attention to details. Abbreviated error handling is just one way that programmers gloss over details. Memory leaks are another, race conditions still another.
        Inconsistent naming yet another. The upshot is that clean code exhibits close attention to
        detail.</p>

    <p>Bjarne closes with the assertion that clean code does one thing well. It is no accident
        that there are so many principles of software design that can be boiled down to this simple
        admonition. Writer after writer has tried to communicate this thought. Bad code tries to do
        too much, it has muddled intent and ambiguity of purpose. Clean code is focused. Each
        function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely
        undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.</p>
